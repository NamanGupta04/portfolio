# 🚀 DevOps-Driven Portfolio Website

This repository contains my **personal portfolio website**, designed and built to showcase not only my projects but also my **hands-on DevOps and Cloud skills**.

Unlike a basic static portfolio, this project follows **real-world production practices** using containerization, orchestration, CI/CD, monitoring, and cloud storage.
